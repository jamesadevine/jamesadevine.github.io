A hackathon last year coincided with the nights drawing in. My son and I had spent the summer cycling our daily nursery commute with a trailer and we loved it!

Our experiences cycling with a trailer during the summer had taught us a few things. Cycling with a trailer is like driving a scaled down articulated lorry—you have to check your blind spots frequently or risk causing an accident. Other vehicles and cyclists do not account for increased stopping distances, wider turning circles, or even the possibility you may even want to turn! It is not uncommon for another vehicle or cyclist to be riding alongside or too close behind you. Hand signals alone do not convey enough information.

We need a better way to communicate our intentions on the roads and cycle paths! Fortunately, there are many examples we can draw upon for expressing intentions on the road. Enter smarter trailer lighting.

## The Innovation

After that dramatic introduction, let me tell you the real story behind our bike light project.

It all started on a cold winter evening when my son and I were cycling home from school. The streetlights were dim, and our cheap bike lights were barely illuminating the path ahead. That's when we realized we needed something better.

## The Challenge

Creating a bike light that's both bright enough for safety and energy-efficient enough for long rides presented several challenges:

- **Battery life**: How do we make it last for hours?
- **Brightness**: LED technology vs. power consumption
- **Durability**: Weather resistance and shock absorption
- **User experience**: Easy controls while cycling

## The Solution

We decided to build our own custom bike light using:

- High-efficiency LED arrays
- Smart power management
- 3D printed weather-resistant housing
- Intuitive touch controls

The result was a bike light that could run for 12 hours on a single charge while providing 1000 lumens of brightness.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught us valuable lessons about:

1. **Engineering constraints**: Working within power and thermal limits
2. **User-centered design**: Prioritizing the cyclist's needs
3. **Iterative development**: Testing and refining our prototypes
4. **Father-son collaboration**: The joy of building something together

The bike light project became more than just a practical solution—it was a journey of discovery, learning, and bonding that we'll remember forever.
