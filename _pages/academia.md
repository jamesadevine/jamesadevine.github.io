My PhD thesis ["Enabling Intuitive and Efficient Physical Computing"](https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/147404/) was formally accepted in May 2020. This work was supervised by [Joe Finney](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/about-us/people/joe-finney) & [Jason Alexander](http://www.jasonalexander.kiwi) and funded by Microsoft.

[CODAL](https://github.com/lancaster-university/codal) is a device runtime that forms part of my PhD thesis. It allows millions of children (and professionals ðŸ˜‰) across the world to program physical computing devices using a web-based visual programming environment, [Microsoft MakeCode](https://makecode.com). CODAL and MakeCode now support the [10 million](https://microbit.org/news/2024-12-09/celebrating-10-million-microbits-around-the-world/) BBC micro:bits in use across the world and thousands of MakeCode Arcade devices like the KittenBot Meowbit, and TinkerGen GameGo.

[Jacdac](https://aka.ms/Jacdac), also a contribution of my PhD thesis, is a new protocol for interconnecting microcontrollers and peripherals. It brings plug and play dynamism to [even the lowest cost and smallest microcontrollers](https://github.com/microsoft/Jacdac-padauk). Using WebUSB, Jacdac also brings together the world of the low cost microcontroller and the web browser for an integrated physical computing experience and beyond. Jacdac has been used as [part of a fashion show in Brooklyn, New York](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/fashion-forward-researchers-designers-debut-new-tech-on-new-york-city-runway/) and a [global company hackathon](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-makeaccessible/#:~:text=Project%20MakeAccessible%20embraces%20the%20idea%20that%20every%20one,assistive%20technology%20to%20address%20the%20long-tail%20of%20disability). Jacdac is used in multiple products from companies like [KittenBot](https://www.kittenbot.cc/products/kittenbot-jacdac-kit-for-micro-bit) and [ForwardEdu](https://forwardedu.com).

Highlights from my research are listed on the [publications](/publications) page.
