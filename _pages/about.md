Greetings!

My name is James Devine and I am currently a senior software engineer at Microsoft. I am skilled systems engineer that can build solutions spanning microcontroller to the cloud. I hold a PhD in Computer Science and my thesis contributes a number of technologies that are used in the Microsoft MakeCode programming environment and supporting device ecosystem. The ultimate goal of my work was to make building custom electronic devices accessible to everyone.

At Microsoft, I currently lead a team responsible for improving the engineering quality of build and release pipelines for Azure Sphere. The work involves safely updating and maintaining legacy software, identifying and addressing root causes of pipeline failures, and safely removing code where ever possible. All in the name of quality and security.

Outside of work, I spend time with my wife and son. I also run a computing club at a local school using the BBC micro:bit. When I find the time, I like to build fun and sometimes useful projects ☺️.
