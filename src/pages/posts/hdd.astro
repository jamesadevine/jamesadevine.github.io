# Hatred Driven Development (HDD)

Hate is a strong word, but it has a strong link to the feeling that builds when I encounter friction in my developer workflow. There comes a point where I can do nothing else but let the hatred flow through me and write code to remove the friction once and for all.

No thought is original and this term was coined in 2009 as ["Hate Driven Development"](https://rc3.org/2009/07/14/hate-driven-development/). I'm recoining it as the word hate is too tame--hatred suits me much better.
