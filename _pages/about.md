Greetings!

My name is James Devine and I'm currently a Graduate Student studying at Lancaster University in the UK, supervised by [Joe Finney](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/about-us/people/joe-finney). My main research interests are curry, beer, and performing live music, although from time to time, I  like to dip my toes into various areas of Computer Science: operating systems, networking, physical computing, and embedded systems.

## An Unexpected Journey

In the summer of 2015 I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and was invited by my final project supervisor [Joe Finney](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/about-us/people/joe-finney) to work on an interesting little project with the BBC. The "little project" turned out to be producing a C++ runtime for a credit card sized educational device called the [BBC micro:bit](http://microbit.org), with one device given to every Year 7 (11---12 year old) school child in the U.K. A little project indeed!

After an exciting summer working with the likes of ARM, BBC, Farnell, Microsoft, Nordic Semiconductor and many more, I decided there was more fun to be had. Off of the back of my work with the BBC micro:bit, I embarked on a journey to obtain a PhD with my now supervisor [Joe Finney](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/about-us/people/joe-finney).

On my journey I'd like to think that I have helped produce a number of works that make complex systems easier to use. The first piece of work is CODAL, the <b>c</b>omponent <b>o</b>riented <b>d</b>evice <b>a</b>bstraction <b>l</b>ayer, used by Microsoft MakeCode to provide [JavaScript semantics with the performance of C/C++](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3211335). CODAL is now used across many devices and processor types including the SAMD, STM32, and NRF5x processor families.

More recently, I've produced a plug-and-play serial protocol, [JACDAC](https://jacdac.org), to network low-cost microcontrollers together (paper upcoming). The elevator pitch: USB for low-cost microcontrollers... except that the protocol is universal to all microcontrollers and actually runs a bus topology ðŸ˜‰.

My final section of work will be to hook networks of JACDAC-based microcontrollers up to the Internet in a safe and secure manner.
