This paper describes the key outputs of IoT4Kids, a project exploring the privacy, security and safety implications of children programming the Internet of Things.We present our Risk Mitigation Checklist in order to illustrate the need for a multi-pronged approach for attending to risks to children from emergent IoT devices, and we discuss what this may mean in terms of industry practice, policymaking and education
