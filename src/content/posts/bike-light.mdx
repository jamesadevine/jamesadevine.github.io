A hackathon last year coincided with the nights drawing in. My son and I had spent the summer cycling our daily nursery commute with a trailer and we loved it! We wanted to keep our commute going through the darker nights.

Our experiences cycling with a trailer during the summer had taught us a few things. Cycling with a trailer is like driving a scaled down articulated lorry––you have to check your blind spots frequently or risk causing an accident. Other vehicles and cyclists do not account for increased stopping distances and wider turning circles. It is not uncommon for another vehicle or cyclist to be riding alongside or too close behind you. Hand signals alone cannot convey enough information about our intentions––even less in the dark.

We needed a better way to communicate our intentions on the roads and cycle paths. Fortunately, this has already been solved on a grander scale. Everyday (most) people use the lights of motor vehicles to communicate intentions. Our task was to model this system on our trailer. Simple, right?

This is a branch new Burley Bee bike trailer. And this is my version of that trailer in 2 dimensions:
