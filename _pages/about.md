Greetings!

My name is James Devine and I am currently a researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge in the UK.

My PhD thesis ["Enabling Intuitive and Efficient Physical Computing"](https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/147404/) was formally accepted in May 2020. This work was supervised by [Joe Finney](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/about-us/people/joe-finney) & [Jason Alexander](http://www.jasonalexander.kiwi) and funded by Microsoft.

[CODAL](https://github.com/lancaster-university/codal) is a device runtime that forms part of my PhD thesis. It allows millions of children (and professionals ;) ) across the world to program physical computing devices using a web-based visual programming environment, [Microsoft MakeCode](https://makecode.com). CODAL and MakeCode now support the 5 million [BBC micro:bit's](https://microbit.org) in use across the world and thousands of MakeCode Arcade devices like the KittenBot Meowbit, and TinkerGen GameGo.

[JACDAC](https://aka.ms/jacdac), also a contribution of my PhD thesis, is a new protocol for interconnecting microcontrollers and peripherals. It brings plug and play dynamism to [even the lowest cost and smallest microcontrollers](https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac-padauk). Using WebUSB, JACDAC also brings together the world of the low cost microcontroller and the web browser for an integrated physical computing experience and beyond. JACDAC has been used as [part of a fashion show in Brooklyn, New York](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/fashion-forward-researchers-designers-debut-new-tech-on-new-york-city-runway/), and has become an established project within Microsoft Research.

My current research interests lie in [tackling the problems introduced by long tail hardware production](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/long-tail-hardware/) and continuing my work to build tools, protocols, and experiences that facilitate a physical computing experience for everyone.
